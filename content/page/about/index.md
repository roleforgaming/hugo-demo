# Who Am I?
My name is Savvy and I'm just a lady who loves TTRPGs (Tabletop RPGs). I run a game at least once a week and have an overwhelming digital library, the majority of which remains untouched. 

# So What is This?
A blog. Duh. Just kidding. This is my attempt at using my Bachelors degree in English/Creative Writing and combining it with my love for TTRPGs. This blog ideally will contain my personal thoughts and musings about different games and systems, as well as contain Actual Plays of solo RPGs and my group games. In the near future we plan on releasing a podcast as well, and you'll be able to find links to that here.

# Get in Touch
If you wanna chat about TTRPGs, join a game I'm running, or you just want to pick my brain, you can contact me on the [Role For Gaming Discord](https://discord.gg/jfJywurUu7).
