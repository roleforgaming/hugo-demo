# Ryuutama
## Introduction
At the time of writing this, we have played four sessions of Ryuutama. From here on out I'll be blogging after each session, but it seems silly to do that for the 4 sessions I have notes on, so I will compile those notes here. 

**Note:  I have not been taking notes focusing on the mechanics of the system - going forward, I plan to be more in depth to give you guys a peek at the systems we use; I will be posting shortly regarding the actual system of Ryuutama and my own thoughts, which I explained in my last post**

## Session One
*This session was generated from a scenario from the Ryuutama Core Rulebook. It was meant to introduce various rules to the players in a scaffolded manner.*

Leo and Pete left their hometown in search of the Kingdom of Winter. They each have goals involving the goods they will be able to find there. En route to the Kingdom of Winter, they come across a market town called Ifa. The guards warned them of the danger of recent theft, so Leo cast a ritual upon Pete to protect him, should they be targeted. They wandered the bustling market until they came upon a herb stand, run by the local orchard man. Pete purchased 3 regular apples (+2 HP each) and 3 candied apples (+2 HP each). Leo purchased a few herbs for his herb bottle (+2 HP each).

Unbeknownst to him, the bottle was stolen shortly after. All he saw was a small catlike person, stand on two legs, wearing pants (a neko-goblin). They locked eyes, and then the neko-goblin ran off. Leo attempted to catch him, but with zero luck. It wasn’t until he finished the chase that he realized his herb bottle was gone. Assuming he must have dropped it, Leo and Pete backtraced their steps several times, but were unsuccessful in finding it. That is when they thought it must have been stolen. They approached the guards, but they were less than helpful, and directed the PCs to stay at the local inn while they investigated the matter.

At the Inn, they were treated to a delicious dinner of roast rabbit with strawberry sauce. While they ate their dinner, they overheard a man grumbling about a neko-goblin thief in the market. The PCs approached him and he offered them 700g each if they found the neko-goblin and returned the things he stole. The PCs agreed and went to sleep.

The next morning, Leo found an herb growing outside of the Inn and he pocketed it. They then heard screaming coming from the market. People evacuated the area as a giant floating gloved hand destroyed carts and vendor booths, accompanied by the very same neko-goblin the PCs confronted the day before. Leo and Pete sprang into action, Leo going after the neko-goblin and Pete going after the hand. Pete was feeling tip-top and easily took down the magic hand. Meanwhile, Leo grappled the neko-goblin who was unable to properly defend himself after being caught up in a bunch of cloth. Eventually the neko-goblin conceded and led the PCs to his burrow, where all manner of items were hoarded. The PCs got back their herb bottle as well as the Inn-man’s items and, in a turn of events, invited the neko-goblin, a white and orange tabby called Milo, to accompany them to the Kingdom of Winter, on one condition: Milo was not to steal unless told to, and when he did, he’d have to share the loot.

## Session Two
As the group traveled from Ifa, heading towards a far off city called Mine Town, a rocky town built on differing levels and burrowed into the side of a hill, they came across a Neko-Goblin in distress. This NG had been captured by a Feral Tribesman, Alex, who was performing some sort of ritual. He embedded dark gems into the creature’s skin and they seemed to sap the NG of all life energy. Milo sprang into action to help his brethren, but was ultimately unsuccessful as he was captured by Alex and the man ran away with him in tow.

Meanwhile, Pete and Leo helped the suffering NG, trying to heal it. Leo successfully heals him of all physical ailments and they get the gems out of his skin, but the process seemed to weaken him even more. They carried him towards Mine Town. They were confronted with a choice: ahead was a broken rope bridge across a ravine – they could attempt to descend and ascend the ravine or even cross the bridge, or they could head into the highlands where they were warned of the Feral Tribe. They decided to take their chances in the highlands.

While out there, they stumbled upon the same man, Alex, with more people from his tribe, performing a similar ritual on Milo, embedding gems into his skin. Pete cast a spell, attempting to disrupt the ritual, but Alex realized before it was able to take effect. While he was caught off guard, Leo cast a spell, directing a flame towards Alex to harm him, however the flame fizzled out and caused little damage. Now fully aware of the PCs presence, Alex and his people attacked.

Before they could get far, a great blue dragon descended upon them and released a mighty roar, causing the tribe to flee in terror. In the blink of an eye, a small girl stood in the dragon’s place. She made eye contact with the PCs then walked off, disappearing into the distance as suddenly as she came.

The PCs collected the two NG’s and proceeded towards Mine Town. Will they be able to find someone who can help them study the seemingly cursed gems? Will Milo convince the PCs he knows a better way to the Winter Kingdom? Will the yet-to-be-named Neko-Goblin survive his ordeal? Tune in next time to find out…

## Session Three
The PCs sought out a clinic to heal up once they reached the city. They then went on the hunt for a Jeweler who might give them insight on the gems in their possession. They find an Artificer who has not much to say about the gems besides the fact that they are cursed. Pete insults his religion and is kicked out from the shop. Alex bursts in before then and Leo fells him non-lethally, allowing him to be taken to jail. Leo is then retrieved by the guard to help them come up with a plan to fortify Mine Town against The Feral Tribe. Leo draws up plans while Pete looks around the market for help with Milo. He is spotted by the servant of Salvatore Gaines, and offers to take him to a place to extract the gems, as long as he got to keep them. He extracts them then turns to mist. Meanwhile, Salvatore introduces himself to Leo and explains the origins of his heroism and the rock surfing contest. Leo convinces him to delay the contest until nightfall.

Pete and Leo end up back together and they go visit Alex, who requested them. Alex revealed that the gems are being used in a ritual to open the portal to Nighttide because "the children of the fae want to return home". He reveals that the ritual will take place during the new year coalescence at the bazaar.

Pete and Leo return to the fortress walls and Pete is commissioned to take Salvatore's place in the race, since he cannot be found. Salvatore's board is enchanted and easily carries Pete down the mountain to victory. At the finish line, they find out Salvatore has kidnapped Princess Sonya and is taking her to the kingdom of winter.

## Session Four
*Unlike the other sessions noted here, I failed to type up a session summary after we played...so upon writing this, it has been two weeks since we have played this session. I will recount it the best that I can.*

The PCs did not have to journey long before reaching the city of Dragonroot. 

>*We lost the town-building mini-game that we did the previous session, so we had to just whip together a cliffsnotes version of what we initially came up with.*

Dragonroot is probably the religious capitol of the world. The city is built upon a mountain and ascends to a grand temple assembled on the peak. At the top of the temple is a platform where, for no small amount of money, people could travel upon the back of Nimbus Cloud Dragons to various destinations far away. The PCs were fairly certain Salvatore had traveled here with the princess and that he was going to steal away on a cloud dragon to make it to the Kingdom of Winter.

The streets were incredibly crowded as people wandered from vendor to vendor. Souvenir shops lined each side, each filled to the brim with various items that represented the religion of the city. The party decided to duck into an abandoned alley, running into a shifty looking gentleman. Leo spoke with the man, who told them he had seen Salvatore and the princess pass through. 

Milo left for the crowded streets to pilfer some money and when he returned he began acting a little shifty. He claimed he knew exactly where they needed to go. The party followed the alley until they ended up at a pair of unfathomably large temple doors. Upon entering the temple, Milo closed the doors behind them and fled. The party explored further and found a one way mirror, where they could see out at the front of the temple where tourists gathered. When they turned around, they were approached by two hooded figures.

On was a man, the other was Milo. A dull purple light illuminated Milo's face beneath the hood. He was in possession of the cursed gems yet again. He attacked however Leo cast a bubble spell that encapsulated Milo. The man released a walking egg. The man then fled, leaving Milo and the egg. Milo urged his former companions to take the egg, which he claimed to be a dragon, through a portal within a temple, though he would not say why. The party did just that.

Once crossing through the portal, they faced a vast expanse of wilderness. The were on a floating island and, upon looking down from the precipice, they could see Dragonroot far, far below. They could see the nimbus dragons making their way through the sky. The portal ceased to exist. Looking ahead, they must journey through a dense wilderness the likes of which neither had ever seen, all with a baby dragon yet-hatched in tow.
