# Ryuutama

## What is Ryuutama?
Ryuutama is a natural fantasy TTRPG that takes notes from Studio Ghibli and Final Fantasy to set the theme. The game is heavily focused on seasons, dragons, and *the journey*, as it were. The players play Travelers while the GM plays a Ryuujin.
###  Travelers
Every character in the world of Ryuutama was a Traveler at some point. It's an accepted part of the lore that at some point in every person's life, they will take a grand journey and travel the world
### Ryuujin
Ryuujin are guardians of the Travelers. As the PC's take on their journey, a Ryuujin watches over the party, logging their travels and eventually returning to a growing dragon where they feed it the stories. These stories make the dragons grow.
### Dragons
Dragons are a HUGE part of Ryuutama. The way the lore works is this:  dragons represent everything about the world - especially the seasons. They are a huge mystery, and little is known about them except that the world remains in perfect harmony due to the birth and growth of dragons throughout the world.

##  The World of Aurora
Before beginning play in Ryuutama, your group plays a world-building mini-game. There is also a town-building mini game; these are some of my group's favorite things about the system. No two worlds in Ryuutama will be alike.
### Shape of the World
Aurora is a discworld, a flat plane held up by four dragons, on the back of a giant shelled dragon meandering through space. The lower and working class live on the ground, the upper class live in the cloud cities floating above, and the royalty live in kingdoms built upon the backs of the seasonal dragons.

### World History
Long, long ago, before anyone can remember, everyone lived on the ground. There were no sky cities, no dragon-mounted kingdoms. The only domain was of the land. But then an event occurred: a parallel fae universe, called Nighttide by the people of Aurora, tore and fae poured out and attacked. The battle was ultimately won by Aurorans, however not without great cost. Nanayotatu, the dragon of gravity, was injured, his powers permanently weakened. This allowed cities to float up among the clouds. As for the kingdoms, each seasonal dragon chose a hero from the battle, and allowed them to build their kingdom upon their back.

To this day, the kingdoms ride upon the back of the dragons as they orbit around the world, bringing the different seasons with them. Once per year on the New Year Coalescence, all of the dragons align above Nanayotatu and everyone comes together to celebrate the victory against Nighttide. On The ground, the world bazaar takes place, in the sky are festivals and parties, and within the kingdoms, grand balls and feasts take place. During this one day per year, everyone treats each other without class and even the poorest people can ascend all the way to the feasts of the kingdoms if they so desire.

### World Enigmas
These are secrets about the world that noone has discovered (yet).

-   The dragons are watching for the Nighttide rift to occur again
-   Nighttide fae were left behind when the portal to their universe closed, and have since produced generations of fae/half-fae in Aurora
-   After the Battle of Nighttide, the capital city of Aurora was sucked into the fae universe when the rift closed, which left a barren crater in the world

### World Threats
Baby dragons are going missing. Nighttide sleeper agents may be among us.

## Characters
What would a TTRPG session zero be without the characters? I currently have a group of 2 players. **Pineapple** playes Leopardus Irti (Leo). **OMGitsjohann** plays Pete. Yep. Just Pete. 

## Conclusion
That's session zero! Upon the publishing of this blog, we have already played around 4 sessions in Ryuutama. It is worth noting that we did not enjoy the system and have since transposed the world of Aurora and the spirit of Ryuutama into Cortex Prime. I'll go into my critique of the system at a later date.
