## Forward
This week we finished up our world building and character creation and managed to have a sneak-peek of the system by playing a short little scenario I prepped.

## The Characters and Their Players
For this game I've gathered three players (though a fourth may join us soon). They're an incredible group of people who have been pretty much game for anything and everything, and for that I am very grateful.

Note:  Funny enough, we forgot to determine what House the characters were in...I guess we will figure that out next time.

**Pineapple** will be playing Rhys Cole, the *Firstborn Caster*. His fear is spiders, his motivation is to find his place in the magic world. He is a shy, naive, and timid underclassman. His animal familiar is Moirai, a Nebelung Cat.

**Johann** will be playing Jerry Quinn, the *Wacky Prankster*. His fear is heights. He is an underclassman. His animal familiar is a Cat.

**Dragon** will be playing Marcus, the *Reluctant Oracle*. His fear is the unknown. He is an underclassman. His animal familiar is a mouse.

## Rumors About the Current Goings-Ons at the School
1. There's a ghost horse at night that people have seen - may be the horse of the prospector, or one of the other founders
2.  Something mysterious living in the well?
3.  All the student dormitories have some kind of dubious enchantment placed on it - there is some trapped item in each of the dorms
4.  The Legend of Cell Phone Reception

## Actual Play
Our party of underclassmen traversed the forbidden mines, in search of the rumored cell phone reception which they had been informed of by an upperclassman. Unbeknownst to them, they had been tricked as payback for an elaborate prank Jerry had pulled on the head boy and girl of his house earlier on in the year. Silly kids, there was no cellphone reception in the mine.

Luckily, the mine was enchanted long ago by the staff at Noon High so that no matter how deep one went, no matter how many turns they took, when they looked back they would be able to see the entrance which, depending on how far they had gone, could be as small as a pinpoint of light - but a light nonetheless.
