## Forward
We were missing a player (Dragon) tonight, but still had a ton of fun! I started using The Location Crafter, pulled back on my reliance on pushing a story with The Adventure Crafter, and we went from there!

## Starting Off
In case you're not familiar with The Adventure Crafter (TAC), it is just a tool in my GM toolbox I have liked using to get some ideas and inspiration for where a story should go. The past several sessions I actually would roll up entire plot lines for the session using TAC, but I found that it would stress me out trying to follow each plot point it gave me, especially when it didn't seem to make sense with where the PCs were at. So instead, I decided to just use it as a starting point and then follow my players' lead from there, and it worked out beautifully!

I also used The Location Crafter (TLC), rules as written, for this session. Basically, you roll on some tables to determine the different locations available to your players, depending on the areas. You can come to it with your own locations you know of, but then you let the table inspire the rest. I personally love to use my players for world building, so I didn't do any prep work with the locations. For the first several scenes you are generally rolling an **Expected** location, so when that occurred, I would just ask my players, "Where do you guys go that is a location expected to be here?" and we would go from there. It was a really awesome tool to keep us focused, as it also gives ideas for encounters and objects.

One of my biggest weaknesses as a GM is my indecisiveness, especially when it comes to snap decisions. TLC gives me just enough prompting to be able to frame a scene that my players can then explore and elaborate on. Go check it out!

## Actual Play
### Last Time
Our party of underclassmen traversed the forbidden mines, in search of the rumored cell phone reception which they had been informed of by an upperclassman. Unbeknownst to them,... [Read More](https://roleforgaming.netlify.app/p/kids-on-brooms/)

### The Watering Hole
We found our young wizards, Rhys (played by Pineapple), Jerry (played by Johann), and Mads (played by Bella), having breakfast in **The Watering Hole**. The Watering Hole is basically the mess hall. On the outside it looks like an old saloon, but the swinging doors open up to an infinitely expandable, two story room with enough seating to accommodate every person on campus.

The gang was discussing going back down to the mines, and why that was probably not the greatest idea. Jerry wanted to go back down immediately, not convinced that what they faced was actually dangerous, while Rhys and Mads vehemently insisted they should just forget about it.

**Edgar Fiddlewood**, a Gunslinger and an Upperclassmen, listened in on the PCs, eventually getting spotted by Mads. He approached the table and proposed that they should indeed go back into the mines to gather research for a Thesis paper he and his classmate/girlfriend **Daisy Buckling** had due at the end of the semester. In exchange for the research, he offered to get their wish into the well at the end of the year.

Jerry was all-in immediately, while Rhys and Mads took a while to come around. Edgar cast a spell that wrote out a contract in the air and signed it. Jerry and Rhys signed it as well (uncertain whether Mads did or not).

### The Study
Tasked with this research, the group thought it a good idea to study up on what's going on in the mines before going back down there. Last time they were down there, they were forced to flee.

The Study is a rather small building with one bookshelf available. The bookshelf itself is enchanted and manifests the book/s that a wizard or witch seeks. Unfortunately, Noon High only owns one copy of each book in its library, and each book is kept on another plane to be retrieved by magic for the wizard or witch that seeks it. If the book has been checked out by another student, they must write their name on the wait list and the book will appear when it is available. The books themselves have been enchanted to return to their plane within an allotted amount of time, meaning they can never be late. Once the book you've checked out reaches its due date, it vanishes into thin air with a "POOF", returning to its plane to be checked out by the next student. Students must be careful not to store their notes inside the book when this happens, as they will disappear along with it, and they will be forced to hunt down the next person who has the book to retrieve what they left inside of it.

Bella's character, Mads, has a Strength that allows her to automatically succeed on most checks that have to do with research, so I allowed the group to find the book they sought - *Mines: A Magical History*. In it they found out that someone had died in the Noon High mine, but further information had been redacted. They then looked for *Wizard Obituaries*, however it appeared that had been checked out to Daisy Buckling.

### The Graveyard & Mausoleum
The group knew Daisy was in the Advanced Necromancy class, taught by The Prospector, so they headed to the graveyard & mausoleum, located at Fogbridge.

Theory of Necromancy is taught within a stone mausoleum, while Practical Necromancy is taught in the graveyard just outside. The bodies of those that are practiced on were donated to the school upon the death of those people (as one might donate their body to science). 

The group came in just as the class ended and witnessed Daisy holding *Wizard Obituaries* and talking to The Prospector. They heard her talking about her thesis and the mines, reassuring the professor that she had everything planned out and in control and she didn't need any additional help.

They approached The Prospector and began barraging him with questions. Mads asked if he was actually dead while Rhys became overcome with anxiety and blurted out everything they had experienced thus far. Pineapple decided to activate Rhys' strength **Innocence** in order to convince an adult not to punish them, so although The Prospector knew they went into the forbidden mine, he gave them a stern reprimand, but withheld more severe punishment for now.

While the PCs spoke to The Prospector, Daisy was distracted enough not to notice Jerry slipping *Wizard Obituaries* out of her bag. Daisy left without noticing and eventually The Prospector also made a hurried exit, unable to entertain the PCs incessant questioning any longer.

### Tree Fort
We determined another **Expected** place for our Region would be akin to a giant tree fort that basically acted as the underclass study hall/common area.

Jerry has a fear of heights, so he had to roll to be able to successfully fly up to the fort. He had a major success and had no problem temporarily overcoming his fear to get up there with his friends.

They found a little study nook that was insulated from the rest of the room and began studying. *Insert research montage here*. Eventually they found that there was a missing page from the *Wizard Obituaries*. Rhys decided it was worth a shot to attempt to summon the missing page to himself, so he pointed his wand out of the window and cited the exact book and page, Chicago Style, that he wanted to try to find. After a few minutes, the page game flying in. Celebration was short, however, because the page not only had a lot of redacted information, but the words that were available to be read were smudged and blurred beyond comprehension due to water damage.

Mads attempted to repair the page, at least to the point of being able to read for a few minutes (this isn't like Harry Potter; to cast a permanent spell increases the difficulty by 6). Unfortunately she barely failed the roll. Mads cast the spell and could see the water damage receding to the point of almost being able to make out the words, but then everything became smudged again. The page ripped out of her hands, tucked itself in the book it came from, the book slammed shut and disappeared with a "POOF".

## Conclusion
