## Forward
One of our most favorite games we've played to date off and on over the past couple of years is a Hogwarts RPG called [Witchcraft & Wizardry](https://www.tablestory.tv/waw/). It's a PbtA game that we enjoyed many sessions in, however PbtA began to get a little stale for the group. The PbtA framework is great for one-shots, in my opinion, but when it comes to extended campaigns, I found it lacking in variety and character growth. As a GM, I felt as if I ran through a loop of different options and the rolls began to feel inconsequential, so we tabled it and pursued other games in the meantime.

Well, we've gotten the Harry Potter itch again and I was directed to check out [Kids on Brooms](https://renegadegamestudios.com/kids-on-brooms/).

##  What is Kids On Brooms?
*Kids on Brooms* is a TTRPG  spinoff of *Kids on Bikes*, an RPG that lets you play kids solving mysteries in your own strange town (think Stranger Things). *Kids on Brooms* is the magic academy equivalent. It is built to focus on the mysteries within the universe you create while simulating the magic academy feel. You build the school collaboratively (we will go more into this below) and the system even includes mechanics that take care of class schedules, which I've found difficult to figure out in my Witchcraft & Wizardry games.

This game simulates a magic school, but not in a way that over-complicates things. It is widely applauded for its magic system, which does not lock you into a specific set of level-based spells; instead, you cast "adjective-verb" spells. You describe what a spell looks like and what it does, then you roll for it to see if it's successful. The previous game I played was pretty simulationist in regards to magic, and as someone who definitely loved Harry Potter/Hogwarts, but did not have the knowledge-base to know the spells and levels of them off the top of my head, casting magic was a little too book-keepy for my tastes and it tended to slow down the pace of the game. I greatly prefer this more free-form use of magic in the mechanics.

Another interesting thing about *Kids on Brooms* is that you aren't tied into playing just a student - you could play an adult as well. For the sake of being able to keep the party together most of the time, I have told my players they would have to decide whether they all are playing students or adults. I have GM'd games where it didn't make sense for a character to be with the group the majority of the time, and playing a NPC to constantly interact with that character was incredibly distracting and exhausting.

## Our World
### Preface
One of my favorite things about *Kids on Brooms* is the collaborative nature of the game, especially when it comes to world-building. This isn't for every GM or every group, though. If you are a GM who prefers to prepare the world then drop your players into it to explore, you could totally do that here - or if your group would prefer not to be involved and want everything to be a mystery they uncover, you could do that too. As for myself and my group, world-building and collaborating on the details is our favorite thing about playing, and we don't mind pocketing meta-knowledge and allowing the characters to discover things we might already know, but that's just us.

### Noon High
#### Introduction
**Noon High Magic Academy** is located outside of the town of Gold Rush in the western United States. It is the 21st century, but you wouldn't know it. Gold Rush is trapped in time, and noone quite knows why or how. The town itself is a mid-late 1800s town. The people are aware the world outside has progressed, but they think all those fancy confangled things just haven't made it to Gold Rush yet. The town itself is hidden from the rest of the world, frozen in time, and cannot be found by outsiders.

On the outskirts of the town is an old abandoned mine shaft, barricaded with wood and a white skull painted on a large rock nestled against the opening. When muggles approach it, they get an extreme sense of foreboding that is only relieved by retreat. For any who press on through that feeling, they are struck with terror and their body flees.

The shaft burrows into the depths of a mountainside, and if one should enter it, they would find themselves on the other side in a valley, a town nestled in the middle. This town is actually *Noon High Magic Academy.* It is laid out like an old western town, each of the buildings representing a classroom. The mess hall, called *The Watering Hold* lies in the center of the town, looking like a small, old saloon. Upon entering, however, the space expands outwards and upwards to accommodate the school population.

#### The Houses
- The Gunslinger House founded by Billy the Kid
- The Tycoon House founded by Bonnie & Clyde
- The Preacher House founded by Deacon Jim
- The Doc House founded by Doc Holiday

#### The Headmasters
The headmaster of the school is a mysterious man called *The Prospector*. Unbeknownst to the students, he is actually a ghost that perished in the mine decades ago, however his spirit still haunts the pickaxe buried in the rock and he is able to manifest himself corporeally as long as he is within a certain range of the haunted item. 

*The Sheriff* is the second head of the school. A new Sheriff is instated every 45 years or so, always coming from the pool of graduates of *Noon High*. There is a Prophesy that exists that destines a student to become Sheriff, however they do not realize their destiny until it comes about.

#### The Past-time
Every magic school has their own unique past-time, and for *Noon High*, that is the High Noon Duel. It is not uncommon to witness standoffs regularly between students and even staff at noon each day. Classes do not occur between the hours of 11AM and 1PM to allow for anyone who wishes to partake in this activity plenty of time to prepare, duel, and recover. Due to the dangerous natures of magic duels, a protective charm has been cast over the school so that any person within it, while they may suffer great harm, will at least not suffer death in the event of a particularly gruesome incident. Be warned, however, that outside of school grounds, this charm does not extend, so duels then can be quite deadly.

#### Landmarks
- The old mining shaft that serves as the entrance and exit into the valley where the school exists
- The Well - an ancient well, dug so deep none can see to the bottom even with the brightest of lights. When you drop something in, you don't hear a splash, and drawing water from it has so-far proven impossible, as the rope seemingly will draw on forever. It is known to have magical properties that grant wishes, however students are expressly forbidden from dropping a coin into the well for a wish. At the end of each school year, the winner of the house cup (I'm interested in coming up with a different name for this) places votes with their Head of House regarding the wish, and the winning vote is then wished for by the Head of House. Genie-rules apply - no money, no love, and no grade-boosting. Also no wishing for more wishes.
- The Barn - On the edge of town is a large red barn filled with hay stacks. One may loudly declare their destination as they jump into the hay and be transported to said destination. The hay itself has magic properties that prevent it from clinging or being dusty, at least for the most part.

#### Unconventional Classes
Within *Kids on Brooms*, you collaborate with your group to come up with at least 2, if not more, classes that are unique to the world/setting you've created.
- **All Aboard! Offensive Maneuvers While Dueling on Wagons and Trains**
- **Husbandry For the Magical Creature**
- **Snake Oils:  Entrepreneurship on the Frontier**
- **Necromancy 101: A Good Wizard's Guide to Raising the Dead**

#### School History (I heard...)
*Kids on Brooms* requests each player come up with a rumor or a truth about the school's history.
- *The Prospector* is an immortal being/vampire (Rumor)
- Billy the Kid's gun is located somewhere in the school (or the mine?) (Rumor)
- Ten years after the school was created, Bonnie & Clyde attempted a hostile takeover of the school, however were unsuccessful. They perished after they were challenged to a duel by two of the three remaining founders. Deacon Jim, who did not challenge them, shot them in the back as they prepared to turn. (Truth)
- There's an old church that appears randomly as if a mirage on the outskirts of the school. On the inside lay the bodies of all of Deacon Jim's victims. You can hear a church bell ring once when it appears. Deacon Jim attempted to cast a charm on the building to hide it from reality, however the spell did not work and caused the building to take on a mind of its own. Ever since, it's wandered aimlessly, appearing only to those who are not searching for it. It is said that if you are inside when the bell rings thrice, you will disappear along with it. (Rumor)

## Conclusion
That is all we have so far! I hope you've enjoyed the read. We still have a small bit more world-building and character creation to complete. Until next time!
